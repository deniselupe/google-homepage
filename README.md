# google-homepage


This repository will include my work for my first project under The Odin Project. This project will help me in getting comfortable in utilizing HTML and CSS when creating new web pages. 


Objective: Build the Google.com homepage.

Links in the navigation and buttons do not need to route the end-user to a new location. The links can be set to 'href=#' if needed.
